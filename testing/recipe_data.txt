Title: Tuscan Chicken Casserole

Ingredients:
1 pound boneless chicken breasts 
1 teaspoon talian seasoning 
1/2 teaspoon paprika 
1/2 teaspoon onion powder 
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 
2 cups fresh spinach 
4 (4 ounce) can sliced mushrooms 
1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes 
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese 
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
3/4 cup heavy cream 
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
1 clove garlic, pressed 
2 ounces cream cheese, softened 
1 1/2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules,  
2 tablespoons chicken broth 
2 tablespoons oil 

Instructions:
 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray an 8x8-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
 Season both sides of chicken with Italian seasoning, paprika, onion powder, pepper flakes, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Place in the prepared pan. Place spinach over chicken, mushrooms over spinach, and sun-dried tomatoes over mushrooms. Top with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
 For sauce, beat cream, Parmesan cheese, garlic, cream cheese, chicken bouillon, chicken broth, and oil together in a bowl until just combined. Season with salt and pepper. Pour mixture over chicken.
 Bake casserole in the preheated oven until bubbly, chicken is no longer pink, and juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes.Â  An instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of chicken should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
